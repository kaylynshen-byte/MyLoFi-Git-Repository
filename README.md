## General Info
**MyLoFi** is an interactive Python-based interface that allows users to create and personalise their own lo-fi soundtrack. Designed with simplicity and creativity in mind, MyLoFi lets users mix and layer multiple instrumental elements—such as piano chords, drums, bass, and ambient effects—to build a relaxing, custom lo-fi beat. The interface features checkboxes for selecting instruments, along with intuitive play, stop, select all, and deselect all buttons for seamless control. Inspired by the calming and nostalgic tones of lo-fi music, MyLoFi provides a hands-on way for users to explore sound design and music layering without needing any prior technical or musical expertise. The aesthetic design combines soft, muted colours and rounded UI elements to reflect the chill, cosy atmosphere of lo-fi culture.
