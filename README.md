## General Info
**MyLoFi** is an interactive Python-based interface that allows users to create and personalise their own lo-fi soundtrack, to study to or to even simply relax to. Designed with simplicity and creativity in mind, MyLoFi lets users select certain instrumental elements, such as piano chords, drums, bass, and ambient effects, to build a relaxing, custom lo-fi beat. The interface features checkboxes for selecting instruments, along with intuitive play, stop, select all, and deselect all buttons for seamless user control. Inspired by the calming and nostalgic tones of lo-fi music, MyLoFi recognises how hard it is to find a lo-fi beat that users enjoy, so why not let them make it by themselves?

## How to set up MyLoFi
### A step by step guide

1. Ensure you have all the elements listed [above](#required-elements)
2. Open **mylofi.py** in Visual Studio Code
3. Go to **line 64-70**
   * Here the code dictates the path to each individual audio file, so we are going to change that to match your laptop:
    * Click onto **Finder**
    * In the sidebar, under Locations, there should be a drive called **Macintosh HD**
    * Click **Users**
      * There, you should be able to view what your mac user is called
4. Change 'kaylyn' to your mac user name
   * Each file line should now say... `fileX = "/Users/macusername/Desktop/lofitrack/______.mp3"`
   *  You're now ready to launch MyLoFi
6. Click the play button in the top right corner to run the code
   * You should now get a python launcher window
7. Tick which elements you want in your lofi track!
8. Click **PLAY** and your lofi track will play continuously until you hit **STOP**
   * You can use the **SELECT ALL** button to tick all the checkboxes at once, and the **DESELECT ALL** button to reset them!
9. Have fun with your new lofi soundtrack!!!!!!

## Room for Improvement
This was a short semester project, thus, it is not completed to the extent that I would like...

So here are some future development ideas:
* Volume settings for each musical element
* More than 1 track
* Better visuals/aesthetics
